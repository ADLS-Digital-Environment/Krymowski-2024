	doi = {10.2112/SI65-100.1},
	abstract = {In any study design, the surveying approach should match the objectives, thereby limiting the effort to focus on the purpose of the inquiry. Often, in beach geomorphological research, study design is based on expert judgment, that does not assure the optimization of the field surveys. In this study, several dimensions of survey strategies were evaluated to compare the outcomes and uncertainties associated with field data collection. The objective of this work is to assess the accuracy of the derived volumes achieved by different survey strategies, including cross- and alongshore lines, with varying density and spatial distribution, to optimize the field survey effort. A number of survey strategies are simulated, covering a range of data resolutions and configurations, replicating a number of possibilities for field data gathering. Topographical data from different field surveying approaches were analyzed for a 4 km long coastal stretch in Portugal. Measures of beach volume were computed from cross-shore as well as alongshore information, and the errors associated with each approach evaluated. Results show that beach volume varies with the adopted survey strategy. As an example, beach volume change can be adequately portrayed and survey effort minimized either through the surveying of 3 alongshore lines, or through 200 m spacing beach profiling. This work highlights the importance of the study design in beach contexts because of its inevitable influence on the results of volumetric change analyses.},

The overall objective of this work was to review the utilization of RF classifier in remote sensing. This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},

Efforts to manage forests depend upon reliable data on the status of and trends in forest resources. When these data come from well-designed natural resource monitoring (NRM) systems, decision makers can make science-informed decisions. National forest inventories (NFIs) are a cornerstone of NRM systems, but requires capacity and skills to implement. Efficiencies can be gained by incorporating auxiliary information derived from remote sensing (RS) into ground-based forest inventories. However, it can be difficult for countries embarking on NFI development to choose among the various RS integration options, and to develop a harmonized vision of how NFI and RS data can work together to meet monitoring needs. The NFI of the United States, which has been conducted by the USDA Forest Service's (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program for nearly a century, uses RS technology extensively. Here we review the history of the use of RS in FIA, beginning with general background on NFI, FIA, and sampling statistics, followed by a description of the evolution of RS technology usage, beginning with paper aerial photography and ending with present day applications and future directions. The goal of this review is to offer FIA's experience with NFI-RS integration as a case study for other countries wishing to improve the efficiency of their NFI programs.},

When applying the OVO strategy to practice, there may be a `tie vote' phenomenon so that some samples cannot be classified. This article proposed a weighted voting mechanism formulated by base classifier accuracy, which is simple and effective to eliminate the unclassifiable area. In addition, one can further improve the classification ability of base classifiers by modifying two-class base classifiers to three-class base classifiers. In the simulation experiments, logistic regression and support vector machine are taken as base classifiers, and the white wine dataset and red wine dataset are viewed as the benchmark of four-class and five-class classification respectively. The results indicate that for multi-class classification, higher accuracy and efficiency can be achieved by modifying the basic classifier and implementing the weighted voting mechanism.},

Remote sensing technology is increasingly exploited for the monitoring of black and odorous water bodies because of its high efficiency and large-scale monitoring potential. In the present study, the Sentinel-2A imagery data were combined with data obtained by measuring spectral properties of black and odorous water bodies to produce a classification and regression tree (CART) model-based improved remote sensing recognition method for such water bodies. This method transforms the traditional single-feature empirical threshold segmentation algorithm to a multi-feature fuzzy decision-tree classification algorithm. The results reveal overall accuracy values of 84.78\%, 92.85\%, and 72.23\% for the CART decision-tree algorithm, the confidence zone classification, and the fuzzy zone node classification, respectively. The method proposed in the present study enables the highly precise extraction of features representing black and odorous water bodies from satellite imagery. The characterization of confidence and fuzzy zones minimizes the need for field inspections, and it enhances the efficiency of diverse applications including engineering.},

	isbn = {978-981-99-9588-2},
	abstract = {Machine learning, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), has gained popularity in geospatial data processing and image classification. Geospatial data from various sources may contain errors, impacting image classification accuracy. Traditional pixel-based and object-based methods struggle to classify complex land cover classes accurately. Previous studies explored machine learning algorithms like Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks. Still, they faced challenges capturing intricate relationships within images and required substantial labeled training data, leading to computational expenses. SVM with polynomial kernels was attempted in some studies, but it suffered from potential overfitting and inefficiency for large datasets. To overcome these issues, this study employed SVM with RBF and Linear kernels to classify multispectral satellite images from the SPOT-6 Satellite Imagery dataset in Sungai Kelang, Malaysia. Previous research evaluated each kernel’s performance accuracy compared using a test dataset, utilizing open-source tools like Jupyter Notebooks and Python libraries to explore SVM’s potential as a high-performance satellite image classification technique. The findings revealed that SVM with RBF kernel outperformed SVM with polynomial or linear kernels in classifying satellite images. The RBF kernel’s robustness allowed SVM to model intricate decision boundaries and capture complex patterns in the image data, making it suitable for tasks with non-linearly separable data. The study introduces a new methodology and theoretical contribution to image classification-related literature, shedding light on the efficacy of SVM-RBF for geospatial data processing. It provides an alternative to traditional approaches for complex image classification tasks. Moreover, the research assists in selecting the optimal algorithm for remote sensing and satellite imagery applications.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {A random forest (RF) classifier is an ensemble classifier that produces multiple decision trees, using a randomly selected subset of training samples and variables. This classifier has become popular within the remote sensing community due to the accuracy of its classifications. The overall objective of this work was to review the utilization of RF classifier in remote sensing. This review has revealed that RF classifier can successfully handle high data dimensionality and multicolinearity, being both fast and insensitive to overfitting. It is, however, sensitive to the sampling design. The variable importance (VI) measurement provided by the RF classifier has been extensively exploited in different scenarios, for example to reduce the number of dimensions of hyperspectral data, to identify the most relevant multisource remote sensing and geographic data, and to select the most suitable season to classify particular target classes. Further investigations are required into less commonly exploited uses of this classifier, such as for sample proximity analysis to detect and remove outliers in the training samples.},

The style of beer varies across the globe but modern brewing is very much the same regardless of the style. While there are thousands of compounds in beer, current methods of analysis rely mostly on the content of only several important processing parameters such as gravity, bitterness, or alcohol. Near infrared and mid infrared spectroscopy offer opportunities to predict dozens to hundreds of compounds simultaneously at different stages of the brewing process. Importantly, this is an opportunity to move deeper into quality through measuring wort and beer composition, rather than just content. This includes measuring individual sugars and amino acids prior to fermentation, rather than total °Plato or free amino acids content. Portable devices and in-line probes, coupled with more complex algorithms can provide real time measurements, allowing brewers more control of the process, resulting in more consistent quality, reduced production costs and greater confidence for the future.},

	abstract = {The present study examines the extent of erosion and deposition along the banks of the lower reaches of the Krishna River (India) between 1973 and 2015, by analyzing the shifts in the bank lines using Landsat images of the years 1973, 1991 and 2015. The analysis is limited to the river segment downstream of the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam up to the Krishna Delta (318 km). The results indicated that the total area lost between 1973 and 1991 due to bank erosion was 3093 ha, whereas the areal extent was reduced to 1386 ha during 1991–2015. Although the individual river reaches had characteristic bank shifting patterns during the period, most of the reaches shifted their banks without changing the bankfull width of the river. Bank erosion was dominated in most of the study reaches during 1973–1991, compared to deposition, while the pattern was reversed during 1991–2015. The contrasting bank erosion/deposition patterns between 1973-1991 and 1991–2015 might be the reflection of the variations in the pattern of flood events between the periods. The impact of the Nagarjuna Sagar Dam on bank erosion is apparent as a sharp increase in the erosion intensity downstream of the dam. The spatial variability of bank erosion is also a function of regional lithology, with marked variability between the Quaternary sediments and other lithological types.},

	abstract = {Following the 2004 tsunami disaster in Sri Lanka, it was apparent that mapping the coast’s vulnerability was essential for future protection of the local populations. We therefore developed a prototype ‘Coastal-hazard GIS’ for Sri Lanka so as to provide an effective tool for decision makers to limit the impact of natural coastal hazards such as sea level rise, tsunamis, storm surges and coastal erosion, and thus protect the exposed assets (population, property, settlements, communications networks, etc.). The prototype was developed on a pilot site in Galle through building up homogeneous data on the land/sea interface from studies conducted on the exposure of the coastal populations, the aim being to enable an evaluation of the hazards combined with the vulnerability and thus an analysis of the risks. Coastal risk scenarios are developed so as to estimate the impacts and consequences of an event (tsunami, storm, etc.) on the assets, the principle behind this being that if, in general, the coastal hazard cannot be decreased, then a better knowledge of it through simulation should make it possible to limit the vulnerability and thus the risk. The Coastal-hazard GIS will also provide a planning tool in terms of locating new settlements, expanding urban areas, siting coastal protection works, etc.},

The change in the coastline (1986–2020) over time was analyzed with remote sensors and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) in conjunction with GIS. A total of 16 indicators were selected to quantitatively evaluate exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to construct a composite vulnerability index (COVI). The endpoint rate (EPR) of the change in the coastline was estimated. The results showed that 35\% of the study area was stable, 18\% of the coastline experienced erosion processes, and 47\% experienced accretion. The COVI analysis revealed that coastal watersheds show great spatial heterogeneity; 31.4\% of the area had moderate vulnerability levels, 26.5\% had low vulnerability levels, and 41.9\% had high vulnerability levels. This analysis revealed that the watersheds located in the northern (Málaga Bay) and central (Anchicaya, Cajambre, and Rapposo basins) parts of the coastal zone were more vulnerable than the other areas.},

This adaptation approach relies heavily on iterative assessment of sea level rise observations and model projections. Remote sensing capabilities from satellites offer an opportunity to assess a consistent set of observational data indicators, around which adaptation pathways can be built. The large-scale nature and broad coverage of satellite observations provide the benefit of consistent monitoring capabilities across the globe, for regions with differing needs, resources, and monitoring capacities. In this study, we identify four categories of data indicators that can be monitored with satellites to support decision making in adaptation pathways: sea level rise, individual processes contributing to sea level rise, impacts of sea level rise, and impacts on implemented adaptation strategies. We review these categories in relation to existing adaptation pathway signposts and the available satellite data. As we highlight the opportunities for satellite-based contributions to sea level adaptation pathways, we also outline potential limitations, opportunities to overcome these limitations, and future steps that can be taken to integrate satellite observations into adaptation pathways.},

	abstract = {Conceptual Framework
Coastal decrepitude is the loss of topographical resources along the coast as a result of silt, temperature fluctuations, tidal shifts, and wave breaking. Hydraulic activity, scraping, abrasion, and erosion are the major causes of erosion; other factors that affect it include the condition of the shore, rocks, joints, fissures, marine chemical reactions, and wave force.
Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are to analyze the coastline changes between 1972 and 2022 utilizing remote sensing and GIS data and forecast the changes in the shoreline in 2032.
Methods
The study examined coastal areas from 1972 to 2022 using multi-temporal satellite data from Landsat TM and Landsat OLI/TIRS. Shoreline change and the calculations related to it were examined using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System using near-infrared bands and tasseled cap transformation, to determine the rate of change in the shoreline, the study also employed Shoreline Change Envelope and End Point Rate techniques.
Results
Coastal erosion caused substantial damage to the island between 1972 and 2022. The northern, southeastern, and western regions of the coast are seeing the highest levels of coastal erosion. The south coast experiences considerable erosion, whereas the west and southeast coasts experience the least. The EPR of Ghoramara Island has mean, minimum, and maximum changes of −10.59, −4.13, and −35.93, respectively. A notable inshore shift has occurred in the northern portion of Ghoramara, extending from 676 m to 855 m. The study also uses tidal gauge records and Revised Local Reference data from the Haldia Gauge Station to track long-term sea level variations. According to the study, Ghoramara Island's shoreline will change by 2032, with the greatest negative changes expected to occur around the island's western and southern borders.
Conclusion
The study shows a significant decrease in Ghoramara's shoreline regions between 1972 and 2022, with a 3,000-population shifted from the place in 2016 due to Lohachara's submergence. Changes in the island's morphology and human activities have reduced cultivation. The study suggests increasing mangrove vegetation to combat coastal erosion and prevent further displacement of people to neighboring islands.},

	abstract = {Climate change is exacerbating shoreline erosion and flooding, posing significant risks to coastal communities. Although traditional coastal defenses such as seawalls, dykes, and breakwaters offer protection from these hazards, their high environmental and economic costs are driving interest in cost-competitive nature-based solutions. Coral reef restoration is a nature-based solution that may be particularly apt to mitigate tropical coastal flooding and shoreline erosion while providing benefits to local tourism, fisheries, and nature. However, the novelty of this field requires studies demonstrating the benefits of reefs for coastal protection. While the flood protection benefits of reefs have been well-documented, their effects on shoreline erosion are comparatively less understood. Here, we investigate the effects of coral reefs on shoreline erosion by comparing tropical beach responses at short and long timescales, as well as identifying important reef structural features influencing coastal erosion rates. Our analyses leveraged two key datasets created in this study: the first derived from a literature review on short-term shoreline erosion due to storm events, and another compiling {\textgreater}80 years of long-term erosion rates, bathymetry, habitat, and wave energy for the Hawaiian Islands of Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, and Maui. Our analyses reveal three key findings regarding the effects of reefs on shoreline erosion. Firstly, we find evidence for the role of reefs in mitigating shoreline erosion during storm events, with coral reef-protected beaches experiencing 97 \% less beach volume loss than unprotected beaches. Secondly, a linear regression analysis demonstrates that coral reef structure and wave energy are important predictors of long-term shoreline erosion rates, explaining 34 \% of the variation across the Hawaiian Islands. Consistent with prior research, we find beaches protected by coral reefs with shallow reef crests, wide reef flats, calmer offshore conditions, and positioned farther from the shore exhibit lower erosion rates than others. Finally, when comparing historical erosion rates of protected and unprotected beaches in Hawai'i, we find a seemingly incongruous pattern where coral reef-protected beaches eroded up to 2x faster than beaches without reefs. While the cause of the enhanced erosion is yet to be fully understood, a combination of coral reef structural degradation and sea-level rise is likely shifting the equilibrium profiles of reef-protected beaches inshore. These results emphasize the role of coral reefs in reducing coastal erosion during storm events while revealing contrasting erosion patterns over long timescales. Future studies would ideally broaden the scope to include various regions, utilize advanced sediment transport models, and undertake field experiments to deepen our understanding of coral reef-coupled shoreline dynamics.},

Depending on how well each country understands coastal systems, different approaches are taken. In Sri Lanka, where coastal erosion has been a long-standing problem, the strategies for managing the coastal zone started out with hard engineering techniques and later evolved to soft engineering solutions. The South-West coast of Sri Lanka has recently been the target of a number of anthropogenic operations, such as off-shore sand mining, mega sand nourishments, and land reclamations, as a result of the country's explosive growth. The impacts of these coastal development activities and existing measures on the prevailing coastal environment are poorly known. A thorough review of current management practices is required in order to assess the physical and ecological sustainability of these measures, which are being driven by recent efforts to preserve the coastal environment and research findings on the environmental impact of erosion mitigation strategies. In this study, openly-available journal articles, impact assessments reports and guidelines, websites, press releases, unpublished data and information about coastal erosion management measures have been reviewed. In addition, the sustainability of different strategies applied, opportunities and challenges of existing measures have been discussed.

	abstract = {Coastal landforms are constantly changed due to both natural and anthropogenic forces. An attempt is made to analyze short-term coastal landform changes on the east coast of Sri Lanka using remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Such landform changes can be classified as either negative (e.g. erosion) or positive (e.g. accretion) impacts. Surface reflectance images of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) were analyzed for extracting spatial and temporal changes, based on cross-shore profile analysis and geomorphic change detection. In this study, we developed a novel script model built-in ArcMap for image pre-processing and processing. This model covers six functioning areas of mosaic, land feature extraction, cloud layer generation, vectorization, cloud masking, and smoothing. The green band and mid-infrared images were selected due to the largest reflectance difference between water and non-water bodies. These images have proceeded with modified normalized difference water index (i.e. algorithm of the script model for extracting water and land features). We also quantified the landform changes such as net shoreline movement, shoreline change envelope, endpoint rate, and linear regression rate, using a digital shoreline analysis system (i.e. statistical software combined with ArcMap™). Therefore, landform changes were classified as erosion ({\textgreater}–2.5 m/year), minor seasonal changes (−2.5 m/year to +2.5 m/year), accretion ({\textgreater}+2.5 m/year), based on the annual variations of endpoint rate (i.e. the distance between the oldest and the youngest shorelines to particular time interval). We visualized spatial and temporal coastal landform changes along the east of Sri Lanka, and also identified short-term landform change drives such as tsunamis, cyclones, and anthropogenic activities (e.g. engineering constructions). These landform changes were observed with a global positioning system (GPS)-based field survey. The understanding of such impacts can be directly applied to sustainable coastal zone management.},
